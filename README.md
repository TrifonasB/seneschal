#### ~ a budget-minded shooping list ~

*Seneschal* is all about managing your groceries or any other shopping list while staying on budget, keep track of your expenses and receive useful insights on the market. It combines a handy minimalistic shopping list, a calculator, money managεment and statistical features.

The development will follow the object-oriented model, and it will be fully documented from the requirεments analysis and various diagrams and models to a complete JavaDoc documentation of the classes.
The programming language of choice is JAVA 8. The tools that we will use are Android Studio, Git, JUnit, MarkDown Navigator, UMLet and others.
